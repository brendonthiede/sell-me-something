                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                      Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                           Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
oftware and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
o take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
he GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
hare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
oftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
NU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
ny other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
our programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
rice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
ave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
hem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
ant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
ree programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
hese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
ertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
ou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
ratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
reedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
r can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
now their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
iving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
hat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
uthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
hanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
uthors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
odified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
an do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
rotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
attern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
se, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
ave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
roducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
tand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
f the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
tates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
oftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
void the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
ake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
atents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
odification follow.

                      TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
orks, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
icense.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
n a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
xact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
arlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
n the Program.

 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
ermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
nfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
omputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
istribution (with or without modification), making available to the
ublic, and in some countries other activities as well.

 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
arties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

 An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
o the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
eature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
ells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
xtent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
ork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
he interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
enu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
or making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
orm of a work.

 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
tandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
nterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
s widely used among developers working in that language.

 The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
han the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
ackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
omponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
ajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
mplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
roduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
he source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
ork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
ontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
ystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
rograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
hich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
ncludes interface definition files associated with source files for
he work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
inked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
uch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
ubprograms and other parts of the work.

 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
an regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
ource.

 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
ame work.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
opyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
onditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
ermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
overed work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
ontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
ights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

 You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
onvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
n force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
f having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
ith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
he terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
ot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
or you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
nd control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
our copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

 Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
he conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
akes it unnecessary.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
easure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
1 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
imilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
easures.

 When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
ircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
s effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
he covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
odification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
sers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
echnological measures.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
eceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
ppropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
eep intact all notices stating that this License and any
on-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
eep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
ecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

 You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
nd you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
roduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
erms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
   it, and giving a relevant date.

   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
   released under this License and any conditions added under section
   7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
   "keep intact all notices".

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
   License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
   License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
   additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
   regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
   permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
   invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
   Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
   interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
   work need not make them do so.

 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
orks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
nd which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
n or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
sed to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
eyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
n an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
arts of the aggregate.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
f sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
achine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
n one of these ways:

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
   customarily used for software interchange.

   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
   written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
   long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
   model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
   copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
   product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
   medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
   more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
   conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
   Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
   alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
   only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
   with subsection 6b.

   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
   place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
   further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
   Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
   copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
   may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
   that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
   clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
   Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
   Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
   available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
   you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
   Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
   charge under subsection 6d.

 A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
rom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
ncluded in conveying the object code work.

 A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
angible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
r household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
nto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
oubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
roduct received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
ypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
f the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
ctually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
s a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
ommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
he only significant mode of use of the product.

 "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
rocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
nd execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
uffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
ode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
odification has been made.

 If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
pecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
art of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
ser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
ixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
orresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
y the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
f neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
odified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
een installed in ROM).

 The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
equirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
or a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
he User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
etwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and
dversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
rotocols for communication across the network.

 Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
n accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
ocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in
ource code form), and must require no special password or key for
npacking, reading or copying.

 7. Additional Terms.

 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
icense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
dditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
e treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
hat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
pply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
nder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
his License without regard to the additional permissions.

 When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
emove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
t.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
emoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
dditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
or which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
dd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
hat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
   terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
   author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
   Notices displayed by works containing it; or

   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
   requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
   reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
   authors of the material; or

   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
   trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
   material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
   it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
   any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
   those licensors and authors.

 All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
estrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
eceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
overned by this License along with a term that is a further
estriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
icense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
f that license document, provided that the further restriction does
ot survive such relicensing or conveying.

 If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
ust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
dditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
here to find the applicable terms.

 Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
orm of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
he above requirements apply either way.

 8. Termination.

 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
rovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
odify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
his License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
aragraph of section 11).

 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
icense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
rovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
inally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
older fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
rior to 60 days after the cessation.

 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
einstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
iolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
eceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
opyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
our receipt of the notice.

 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
icenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
his License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
einstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
aterial under section 10.

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
un a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
ccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
o receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
othing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
odify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
ot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
overed work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
eceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
ropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
or enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

 An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
rganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
rganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
ork results from an entity transaction, each party to that
ransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
icenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
ive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
orresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
he predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

 You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
ights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
ot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
ights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
ny patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
ale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

 11. Patents.

 A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
icense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
ork thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

 A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
wned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
ereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
y this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
ut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
onsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
urposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
atent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
his License.

 Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
atent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
ake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
ropagate the contents of its contributor version.

 In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
greement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
ue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
arty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
atent against the party.

 If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
nd the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
o copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
ublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
hen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
vailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
atent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
onsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
icense to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
ctual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
overed work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
n a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
ountry that you have reason to believe are valid.

 If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
rrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
overed work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
eceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
r convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
ou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
ork and works based on it.

 A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
he scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
onditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
pecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
ork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
n the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
o the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
he work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
arties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
atent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
onveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
or and in connection with specific products or compilations that
ontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
r that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

 Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
ny implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
therwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
therwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
xcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
overed work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
icense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
ot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
o collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
he Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
icense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
ermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
nder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
ombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
icense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
ut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
ection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
ombination as such.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
he GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
e similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
ddress new problems or concerns.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
rogram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
ublic License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
ption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
ersion or of any later version published by the Free Software
oundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
NU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
y the Free Software Foundation.

 If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
ersions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
ublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
o choose that version for the Program.

 Later license versions may give you additional or different
ermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
uthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
ater version.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
PPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
OLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
F ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
HE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
URPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
S WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
LL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
ILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
HE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
ENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
SE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
ATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
ARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
VEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
UCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
bove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
eviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
n absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
rogram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
opy of the Program in return for a fee.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
ossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
ree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
o attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
tate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
he "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

   <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
   Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

   This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
   the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version.

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

lso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

 If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
otice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

   <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
   This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
